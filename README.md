Here is a link to my video detailing my project:

I had some difficulties with downloading pygame since I have an older computer and downloading a font from Google Fonts to use.
I also had to take some time to space the four button choices correctly so the player will not click the wrong one on accident.
I learned how to get text to appear using code and how to make the game interactive for the players using buttons to press.
I enjoyed seeing it all come together and I think it would be a good tool to test the reaction time of people or use as a competition to see who gets the most right.
I was able to complete all my goals such as creating a timer and giving the players the color options to choose from when playing the game.
