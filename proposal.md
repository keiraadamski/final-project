# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

My project will be titled "Determining The Genotype and Phenotype of Offspring"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will allow a user to input the alleles for two parents and ouput the alleles for potential offspring.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will prompt the user to input the alleles for each parent based on their hair and eye color. 
For example, BB or Bb can signal the parent has brown eyes and bb can signal that the parent has blue eyes. 
Once, they are inputed the software should output a punnet sqaure with all the outcomes for the offspring.
Another feature along with the punnet sqaure is a section that tells the user the percentages of a child having certain features (Ex: blonde hair and blue eyes)
It will be executed using an input function, def functions, and others.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect (s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In a world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create a punnett sqaure that shows the allele outcomes of two parents.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish making a punnett sqaure that can give the outcomes along with the percentages of phenotypes for the offspring.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be adding some features that can do it for a variety of hair and eye colors.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will yoy need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next step would be to gather all the functions I need to use and maybe write them out in a list before I put them in IDLE.
I might need to learn how I can make an outline around letters to construct a punnett square.
I need to research some information about punnett sqaures and how they are formed with the provided alleles from the parents.
I also might have to figure out how to do the percentages for the phenotypes after the punnet sqaure is constructed.
I will complete all the steps in this project individually.
