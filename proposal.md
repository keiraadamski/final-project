# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

My project will be titled "Testing the Stroop Effect"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It will allow test what the user inputs for the name of a color printed out in a different color.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will prompt the user to enter the letter of the color that the word is printed in. 
For example, if the word "red" is printed in green the user should respond with "g". 
There will be a timer that will end the program when a certain time is passed and say how many were correct.
Another feature could be a few buttons and the user will have to choose the right answer based on them.
It will be executed using an input function, def functions, for loops, and others.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect (s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In a world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create a program that prompts the user to input the letter of a the color that the word is printed in.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can accomplish the input function as well as the timer that makes the program stop once a certain time has passed.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be adding some features like buttons that the user will have to choose between when deciding the color the word is printed in.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will yoy need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next step would be to gather all the functions I need to use and maybe write them out in a list before I put them in IDLE.
I need to learn how to use pygame and import it into python so I can make the game interactive for the user.
I need to research some information about the stroop effect and make sure I am using it the proper way to test the theory.
I also might have to figure out how to construct a timer that ends the program after a certain amount of time.
I will complete all the steps in this project individually.
